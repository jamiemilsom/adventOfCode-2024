# Advent of Code 2024  

Welcome to my **Advent of Code 2024** repository! ðŸŽ„  

## Purpose  
Iâ€™m using this years advent of code to improve my software development skills, with a particular focus on **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** aswell as a general fun challenge. All solutions are implemented using Python, and tests are written and executed with **pytest**.  
Iâ€™ve kept library usage to a minimum in this project because I believe implementing most of the puzzles from scratch is the best way to learn. That said, Iâ€™ve made an exception for **NumPy**, as practicing data manipulation with it is invaluable given its importance in machine learning.

## Structure  
Each day of the challenge has its own folder containing:  
- `dayX.py`: The implementation for that day's puzzle.  
- `test_dayX.py`: Unit tests written in pytest, following the TDD approach.
- `task.txt`: The task description from https://adventofcode.com/
- `input.txt`: The provided puzzle input from https://adventofcode.com/

Example folder structure:  
```
day1/  
  â”œâ”€â”€ day1.py  
  â”œâ”€â”€ test_day1.py
  â”œâ”€â”€ task.txt
  â”œâ”€â”€ input.txt

day2/  
  â”œâ”€â”€ day2.py  
  â”œâ”€â”€ test_day2.py
  â”œâ”€â”€ task.txt
  â”œâ”€â”€ input.txt
...  
```  

## Goals  
- Practice **TDD principles**: Write tests before implementing functionality.  
- Reinforce Python fundamentals and problem-solving skills.  
- Stay consistent and complete all 25 days of the challenge.
